# customer-recency
 On a scale of 1-3, with 1 being least valuable and 3 being most valuable, can you classify customers based on recency of last purchase? For example, a purchase made 1 month ago is more valuable than one made 5 months ago, so the former customer would have a higher recency score than the latter. You can download the data here.  For more information regarding customer lifetime value, you can read this post from Shopify's blog.
